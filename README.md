# tarotBotDiscord

This is a simple bot to count the point of a game of Tarot.
It also made me discover how node.js worked, which is nice.z

Duration: 1 week.

# How to use it
Install the discord.js depencies with npm  
rename the config.json.example file to config.json and replace the bot token and id with yours  
run the test.js file with node  
Add the bot to your server : https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id={bot-id}&response_type=code  
type !help to get started

# TODO
- Refactor the code
- Find a nice way to replace the "switch" on each command
- Write the package.json file
- Implement the tarot card game (yes, it's a pretty long task)

Project on a hold right now
